# Marketing Email Challenge
* note: MSRP (manufactured suggested retail price) is listed as MSPR in csv and MRSP in sketch file which is likely a typo

* I chose overflow auto on product descriptions to allow the user to scroll to read all information while staying within design restraints and not having a loss of information with hidden or making the font too small to read

## Overview of Files
* index.html = initial file created to match the given sketch file

* start.html = raw template (index.html without the product information )

* productInformation.csv = exported csv from the provided excel file

* script.rb = used to fill out the product information table for each product in productInformation.csv

* end.html = the completed html file
